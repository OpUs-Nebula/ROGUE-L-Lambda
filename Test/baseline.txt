Two private individuals exchanged their vehicles with each other through an exchange agreement. The buyer performed two simple visual inspections of the seller's vehicle before the exchange took place, after which the buyer's wife pointed out a smell of mold in the vehicle. The seller downplayed the remark and gave a reassuring explanation as to why it smelled like mold. No more thorough inspection was carried out before the transmission took place and the vehicle was sold in "existing condition" according to the exchange agreement. At a later time when the buyer used the vehicle, the smell of mold became increasingly clear, which led to a more detailed inspection of the vehicle. The more detailed inspection showed that the vehicle had extensive mold damage. A cancellation declaration was thus sent from the buyer to the seller, who in turn refused to cancel the purchase.
